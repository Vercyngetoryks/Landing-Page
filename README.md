# Landing-Page

AutoTech Garage - Landing Page
This is my first project, a simple landing page for a fictional automotive repair shop called AutoTech Garage. The purpose of this project is to practice web development skills, including HTML and CSS.

Features:

- A hero section with a catchy slogan and call-to-action.
- A services section that highlights the key offerings of the workshop.
- A testimonials section with customer feedback.
- A clear call-to-action (CTA) to book an appointment or contact the workshop.

Technologies Used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Google Fonts for typography.

Purpose:
This project is a practice project for learning the basics of web development. It showcases a clean and simple landing page design that could be adapted for a real-world automotive shop or any other service-based business.
